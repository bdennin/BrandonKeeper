# BrandonKeeper
Welcome to BrandonKeeper.  BrandonKeeper embodies my passion for video games.  It is my senior project which I wrote while studying at Westminster College.  It is written entirely in C++, with imports from SFML, the Simple and Fast Media Library.  It implements several algorithms, many of which were created by me, such as how units move around the world or execute work, and some which were not, like A* graph search.  It also uses an extremely-wide array of data structures, way too many to even list. It also exploits the benefits pointers for speed, and nullifying copy times.

The main purpose of this simulation was to attempt to recreate a classic game from the 90's, Dungeon Keeper.  When the project first started, I had no idea how far I would end up getting, but I accomplished everything I wanted to complete!  It has an in-game world and scrollable camera, implements A* graph search, has a worker unit that runs around and excavates a subterranean arena, a save feature, and tons of sounds and music.  This was my favorite project that I worked on at school, and I would love to one day work for a gaming company.
